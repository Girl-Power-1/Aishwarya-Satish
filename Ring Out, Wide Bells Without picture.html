<h2><font color = white><u>About the Author</u></font></h2>
<p><font color = white>Alfred Lord Tennyson {1809 - 1892}</font></p>
<h3><font color = white>(6 August 1809 â€“ 6 October 1892) was a British poet. He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign and remains one of the most popular British poets. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, "Timbuktu". He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. "Claribel" and "Mariana", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</font></h3>

<h3><font color = white>Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br>The flying cloud, the frosty light:<br>The year is dying in the night;<br>Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><font color = white>Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br>Ring, happy bells, across the snow:<br>The year is going, let him go;<br>Ring out the false, ring in the true.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><font color = white>Ring out the grief that saps the mind<br>For those that here we see no more;<br>Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br>Ring in redress to all mankind.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br><h3><font color = white>Ring out a slowly dying cause,<br>And ancient forms of party strife;<br>Ring in the nobler modes of life,<br>With sweeter manners, purer laws.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br><h3><font color = white>Ring out the want, the care, the sin,<br>The faithless coldness of the times;<br>Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes<br>But ring the fuller minstrel in.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br><h3><font color = white>Ring out false pride in place and blood,<br>The civic slander and the spite;<br>Ring in the love of truth and right,<br>Ring in the common love of good.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br><h3><font color = white>Ring out old shapes of foul disease;<br>Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br> Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br>Ring in the thousand years of peace.</font></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br><h3><font color = white>Ring in the valiant man and free,<br>The larger heart, the kindlier hand;<br>Ring out the darkness of the land,<br>Ring in the Christ that is to be.</font></h3>
